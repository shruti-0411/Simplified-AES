# Simplified-AES & DES

#AES
Using polynomial multiplication and reduction for the mix column multiplication
INPUT 16 bit key and 16 bit data that is to be encrypted

#DES 
INPUT 10 bit key and 8 bit data that is to be encrypted

In both the encryption standard I have created seperate functions for different tasks like Left shift, Sbox substituion, Mix Col multiplication etc
